This report details the responses from UCLA exit surveys that were completed by graduating statistics majors in Spring 2019. In this study, we investigated whether Statistics 140 and 141 SL courses were worthwhile to improve students’ soft skills, hard skills, and relative learning skills. Also, we investigated which factors are the most significant in student’s statistical performance. We fitted a multiple linear regression model and used ANOVA to investigate which variables are significant. Overall, the anova of multiple linear regression reveals that the soft skill and data management skill vary among different GPAs, but not related to gender, whether transferred from community college or whether their English proficiency. Afterwards, there were some limitations such as NA values and existence of confounding variables. We already removed NA values via PCA and further research for hidden variables needs to be investigated.
